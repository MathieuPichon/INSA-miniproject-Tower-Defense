# INSA-miniproject-Tower-Defense
Repository for our 2015 class mini project about coding a towerdefense game

Instructions :
Put all your files in the master branch, since everytime we push stuff, a backup is made it will manage our archive for use.

Try keeping the number of file low since we cannot do directories (it would need to be branches), If you find interesting GIT commands, please create a text file in it so we can all have them.

Remeber to add comments/small notes when you push changes so we know what you are doing!
